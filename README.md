# **AI-Converter**

AI-Converter is a command-line utility that allows users to interact with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model, generate text based on custom prompts, and save the generated results to a file and clipboard. Users can define and execute multiple custom commands based on pre-defined prompts.

## **Features**

- Interactive command-line interface
- Customizable commands with pre-defined prompts
- Input text using a Vim-like editor
- Automatically saves results to a file
- Copies results to the system clipboard

## **Installation**


1. Install[ Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) if you haven't already.

2. Run `go install`

```bash
go install github.com/YanniHu1996/ai-converter
```

## **Usage**

To use AI-Converter, simply run the following command in your terminal:

bash


```
./ai-converter [command]
```


Replace `[command]` with the name of the custom command you want to execute. The utility will prompt you to enter text, which it will send to the OpenAI API. The generated response will be saved to a file and copied to your clipboard.


## **Configuration**

To create custom commands, edit the `commands.json` file in the `~/.ai-converter/` directory. Here's an example configuration:

json


```
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "improver",
    "prompt": "Correct and improve the following text"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "summarizer",
    "prompt": "Summarize the following text"
  }
]
```


Each command object should have an `id`, `name`, and `prompt`. The `name` is used to execute the command, while the `prompt` is sent to the OpenAI API as part of the input.
